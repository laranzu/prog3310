In this tutorial you will

\DOT Check the cryptographic signatures of files

\begin{IMPORTANT}
A real world server that only one person can use at a time would not be very

Reliability Engineering. Do \emph{not} use threads, timeouts, async\ldots
in your assignments without first asking if you really need to.
\end{IMPORTANT}

\STEP Modify the server \texttt{handleRequest} code so that it uses the special
\NAME{slowSend} in the socket line library instead of \texttt{writeLine}.
