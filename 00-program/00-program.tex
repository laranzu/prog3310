Here is some sample code

\begin{CODE}\begin{verbatim}
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(string args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
\end{verbatim}\end{CODE}

This is a shell command

\CODELINE{> python peasant.py}

\MINOR{Testing math}

Instead of being equal to mass, the points cost for the hull becomes
\[ hull\ =\ \frac{mass^{2}} {100} \]
rounded off to the nearest integer.

For example, the \emph{Suffren} class light cruiser from Fleet Book 1
has mass 54 and a points cost of 181. Using the CPV calculation, the hull cost is
\[ \frac{54^{2}}{100} = \frac{2916}{100} = 29 \]
a reduction of 25 points for a new total points cost of 156. On the
other hand, an \emph{Excalibur} class dreadnought has mass 140 and points cost
472. Using the CPV, the hull cost is
\[ \frac{140^{2}}{100} = \frac{19600}{100} = 196 \]
an increase of 56 for a new total points
cost of 528.


And we are done.
