\TITLE{Programming Warm Up}

\MINOR{Outline}

The goals of this tutorial are:

\DOT Make sure you have the necessary software for this course.

\DOT Make sure you can compile and run programs from the command line.

\DOT Introduce you to Inter Process Communication and the problems that can arise.


\MINOR{Software}

Tutorials are designed and tested on \TT{Linux}, as used in the CSIT Lab workstations.
Usually everything will work on \TT{MS Windows} or \TT{MacOS X} (x86) without change,
or with minor modifications.

\TT{Python} and \TT{Java} are the \DQ{official} programming languages for this course.
Most tutorials are supplied in both these languages, and most students use one or the
other for their assignments. Most tutorials require only the standard built in libraries.

For Python any version from about 3.7 on will work. You won't need type annotations,
match-case statements, async code or other features from newer releases.

For Java use JDK 17, the long term release. You won't need virtual threads,
records, string templates, or other new features.

Tutorials are designed for a command line environment. On Linux and MacOS this is the
\TT{Terminal} application. On MS Windows, use \TT{PowerShell}, \emph{not} the command prompt.
We won't be writing shell scripts and usually the same commands work in all
three systems.

(Why a CLI, Command Line Environment? This is not to make things deliberately hard,
or trying to bring back the computers of the previous century. Most networked computer
programs, and most computer network administration, does not use a GUI. This course is
about networks, not GUI programming.)

You will need some way to edit your Python/Java programs. Any text editor will do:
\TT{Sublime Text Editor} or \TT{Atom} are good choices on any system, \TT{BBEdit} on
Macs. You \emph{can} use an IDE such as \TT{Eclipse}, \TT{PyCharm}, or \TT{Visual Studio}
if you prefer, but you \emph{must} be able to run your programs from the command line.
Assignments are submitted in source code form to your tutor, who probably won't have
the same IDE as you. If your programs can't run from the command line, they won't be
marked.

You need to know how to decompress / extract \TT{ZIP} archives, and later on you will
be submitting your assignments in ZIP form. ZIP, \emph{not} 7z or RAR or tar.
And please don't put spaces or funny characters in file and folder names.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and now is the time for all good men to come

Here is some sample code

\begin{CODE}\begin{verbatim}
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(string args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
\end{verbatim}\end{CODE}

This is a shell command

\CODELINE{> python peasant.py}

\MINOR{Testing math}

Instead of being equal to mass, the points cost for the hull becomes
\[ hull\ =\ \frac{mass^{2}} {100} \]
rounded off to the nearest integer.

For example, the \emph{Suffren} class light cruiser from Fleet Book 1
has mass 54 and a points cost of 181. Using the CPV calculation, the hull cost is
\[ \frac{54^{2}}{100} = \frac{2916}{100} = 29 \]
a reduction of 25 points for a new total points cost of 156. On the
other hand, an \emph{Excalibur} class dreadnought has mass 140 and points cost
472. Using the CPV, the hull cost is
\[ \frac{140^{2}}{100} = \frac{19600}{100} = 196 \]
an increase of 56 for a new total points
cost of 528.


And we are done.
